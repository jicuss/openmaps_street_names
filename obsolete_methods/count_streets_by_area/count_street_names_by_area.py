                                          Failed Attempt: Find Streets By Area
This script was my first attempt at counting all streets in the US. In the end I realized this was a flawed approach.
Clearly I could not request all streets in the US with one API call. I needed to break the API calls into discrete units
small enough that the Openmaps server could respond in a limited amount of time. My plan was to grab all states in the US,
iterate through the states to grab all cities, then grab the streets in each of the cities. What I found was that the
metadata for cities was pretty inconsistent. This meant that the API query used to return the ways for a given city
did not consistently return valid results. Lets look at a few examples of how this approach failed to return valid queries.

Best Case:
Escondido, CA
https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/253832
admin_level - 8
border_type - city
boundary - administrative
is_in:state - California
name - Escondido
place - city


Notice that the is_in:state metadata key associates the city correctly with the state. This meant that if I searched for Escondido,
I could scope the results to only streets Escondido, CA. If another Escondido existed in the world, results for that town would not be returned.

Escondido, CA is next to San Diego, CA. Results for San Diego were not being returned correctly. Lets look at the metadata stored for San Diego.

San Diego, CA
https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/253832
admin_level - 8
border_type - city
boundary - administrative
name - San Diego
place - city

In this case, the is_in:state key is not defined. This prevented the previous query that included the is_in:state key from operating properly.
I ended up writing an alternative query that would get called in the event that no ways being returned and continued with the project.

This approach again hit a snag when I realized that Denver, CO was returning results for Denver, CO

Berkley, CA
https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2833528
admin_level - 8
boundary - administrative
is_in:state_code - CA

In this case, the place key is undefined, as is the border type. This once again prevented the API queries from operating properly.
Rather than try and make queries for every edge case required to return valid responses for all cities, I started a new approach
where I applied lat long boundaries then iterated traversed the US. This didnâ€™t rely on the city metadata to be correct, but did
by default include small portions of Mexico and Canada that would need to be excluded during the final street count tally.
